## AWS Helper Scripts
Library of scripts that I use for common tasks

- `get-currentamis.py` - Get latest AMI for OS type/region; currently supports subset of operating systems (see script)
- `get-azs-in-region.sh` - Get AZs in region
- `validate-template.py` - Cloudformation template validation (single or directory)
